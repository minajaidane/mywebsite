            <p><span class ="big__font">Nice to meet you</span>, I’m Mina Jaidane a 22 years old communication student. 
              Before I started studying communication I studied programming en eventmanagament. Since then I’m really into digital analytics and front-end development. That’s partly the reason why I made this website from scratch. </p>
              
              <p>Well, enough about school, I’m going to tell you a little more about what I like to do when I’m not studying.
              I like to sport, I’m a former judoka. But sadly I had to stop because of an injury But that doesn’t mean I don’t sport anymore, I like to swim and run. 
              Another thing where I’m really passionate about is my student work. I’m a little bit of a workaholic. I currently working on a matchingplatform for an agency in Ghent. </p>
             
              <p>And last but not least, when the world is COVID19 free, I like to travel and walk. Visiting different countries to develop myself.</p>
